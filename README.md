# leaflet-challenge

1. Visualize an earthquake dataset. 

2. Import and visualize the data by doing the following:

    - Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

    - Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

    - Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
